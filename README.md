# Deep Evolutionary Fitness Inference for Variant Nomination from Directed Evolution

This repository incldues

- `datasets`: Public datasets and newly released multi-round selection NGS datasets (Yeast display on antibodies on FGFR1, and mRNA display on macrocyclic peptides on TEAD)
- `deepfitness`: Code to run EVFI and DeepEVFI
- Code and notebooks to reproduce results in our manuscript, in `Enrich2`, `ACIDES`, and `notebooks`, with `data-exp` (Experimental data with SPR KD measurements), `results-data`, `run-alltime`, and `run-benchmarks`.
    
The ACIDES, Enrich2, and deepfitness directories contain code and scripts to run each respective method. Each directory also contains an env.yml for installing conda environments.

Commands and configs for running each method are provided in run-alltime and run-benchmarks.
